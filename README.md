# React Router Tutorial / Demo

This project was made following the step by step guide in the [React Router Docs](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial), with the purpose of getting familiar with the new syntax that came with the React Router 6 version and the new `createBrowserRouter`.

It is a simple contacts application that helps you keep track of contacts, by letting you create, edit, remove, favorite and search. The app's functionality lets us understand and explode React Router's capabilities and explore the scenarios in which we could take advantage of the built-in methods and hooks.

Bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Available Scripts

The project can be initialized with `npm start` after installing the dependencies (`npm install`).
